# Abstract
Our main question is how has Volleyball changed over time? In other words, how does this data show trends in success amongst different Volleyball players and teams.
This question is important because this can help shape the success of the future of Volleyball (teams and players) by having the data be more accessible to all future athletes.
To address the question, we will compile, organize, and visualize Volleyball data from Olympics Volleyball games to allow the data to be more accessible to those who are unable to do this themselves.


We are concerned with how unorganized and scattered professional Volleyball data is, because success in sports is often determined and influenced by sports data, which is often unavailble to the smaller players. To address this concern, we plan to make this data available to the smaller players, giving them the chance to use this data to their advantage.

# Introduction
In the world of professional sports, data on even the most popular sports can be confusing to find.  Trying to search for sports statistics can lead to loads of information and different statistics on the sports. However, the information can often be scattered and not easy to comprehend. The information for tournaments around the world might be in one place, where the stats for specific players might be in another. If someone wanted to easily access a comprehensive amount of data on a sport they would have to go searching in multiple places. Our goal for the project was to be able to create a place where athletes, coaches, or even spectators of Olymppic Volleyball could go and find most of the information they were looking for. We not only wanted this project to have the data they were looking for, but to also have it be more easily comprehensible for its use for the more casual fan.
