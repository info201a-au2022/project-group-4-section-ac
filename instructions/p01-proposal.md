# Abstract
Our main question is how has Volleyball changed over time? In other words, how does this data show trends in success amongst different Volleyball players and teams.
This question is important because this can help shape the success of the future of Volleyball (teams and players) by having the data be more accessible to all future athletes.
To address the question, we will compile, organize, and visualize Volleyball data from Olympics Volleyball games to allow the data to be more accessible to those who are unable to do this themselves.


We are concerned with how unorganized and scattered professional Volleyball data is, because success in sports is often determined and influenced by sports data, which is often unavailble to the smaller players. To address this concern, we plan to make this data available to the smaller players, giving them the chance to use this data to their advantage.
