# Abstract
Our main question is how has Volleyball changed over time? In other words, how does this data show trends in success amongst different Volleyball players and teams.
This question is important because this can help shape the success of the future of Volleyball (teams and players) by having the data be more accessible to all future athletes.
To address the question, we will compile, organize, and visualize Volleyball data from Olympics Volleyball games to allow the data to be more accessible to those who are unable to do this themselves.


We are concerned with how unorganized and scattered professional Volleyball data is, because success in sports is often determined and influenced by sports data, which is often unavailble to the smaller players. To address this concern, we plan to make this data available to the smaller players, giving them the chance to use this data to their advantage.

# Introduction
In the world of professional sports, data on even the most popular sports can be confusing to find.  Trying to search for sports statistics can lead to loads of information and different statistics on the sports. However, the information can often be scattered and not easy to comprehend. The information for tournaments around the world might be in one place, where the stats for specific players might be in another. If someone wanted to easily access a comprehensive amount of data on a sport they would have to go searching in multiple places. Our goal for the project was to be able to create a place where athletes, coaches, or even spectators of Olymppic Volleyball could go and find most of the information they were looking for. We not only wanted this project to have the data they were looking for, but to also have it be more easily comprehensible for its use for the more casual fan.

# Problem Domain
The current designs for information technology on sport statistics is inaccessible to the average person. Finding data on current and past players of professional/Olympic-level Volleyball can be challenging. Creating a single place for viewing the statistics of Olympic-level Volleyball results can help people in using this data for reports, articles, analysis, etc.

## Human Values:
Some human values directly tied to our problem domain are guiding others towards the right action, achievement, and self-direction. By creating an active archive of data of Olympic Volleyball, we record history for current and future generations to view. It recalls past achievements for people to look back on. If for example, a young child wanted to be successful in professional volleyball, they could access the data easily and find individuals who were successful in the field. Then using that data, research that person further for better insight. These values originate from self-fulfillment and this concept that a person has the power to pursue what they want in life. A value tension could be seen with humility. When one achieves their desired endeavors in life, sometimes the ego can clash with humbleness.

## Stakeholders:
The direct stakeholders include all volleyball athletes, analyzers, coaches, players, and professional teams. It is assumed they have a general interest in volleyball and desire to continually engage in it. It is also assumed they know how the game operates as well as the different levels of competition. Some of the values they hold include self-fulfillment and action. A desire to learn more and know what is happening within the world of volleyball is their motivation.
An indirect stakeholder would be the professional teams and their athletes. Their career is playing volleyball, so they may never see the statistics written about them; However, it indirectly affects them because the data is written about them.

## Benefits and Harms:
If interventions are taken with data and technology, a potential benefit could be live statistics. For example, if the intervention in technology is more updated information systems that can easily load in new data then any viewer would have the most current information. This would benefit any people viewing the datasets because they are seeking and receiving desired information. On the opposite side, if the intervention was adding additional information on players, it could also become an invasion of privacy. For example, an unanticipated consequence could be that because a player had a bad game a report could be linked to their poor performance, in addition to the loss, and harm to their reputation.

# Research Questions
## 1. Which countries have the most/best results (most medals) over the years?
This question is important because we can see how it is able to show a good general growth of the sport in certain areas. People might want to know which countries to follow styles from.
## 2. Does being from a certain country help with performance?
This question helps us determine if external factors behind an athlete have any effect on their performance. Athletes might want to keep these factors in the back of their mind.
## 3. Which countries have hosted the most Olympics? What do they have in common?
With this question we would be able to see if the home country has any advantage in the Volleyball matches vs. the countries who are not hosting the game. This might be considered by officials of events to analyze different advantages.
